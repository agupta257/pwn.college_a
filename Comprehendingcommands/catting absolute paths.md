In this challenge we have to use cat's arguments as absolute paths.
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{InsyZHJ3nJ-Sm3DZWh9ddgclak1.QX5ETO0wCN4kjNzEzW}

In this challenge, I used the cat command at its absolute path to find the flag.

```bash
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{InsyZHJ3nJ-Sm3DZWh9ddgclak1.QX5ETO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn that the cat command can read at its absolute path and that flag is where the flag always lives in pwn.college.

## Refernces
Did not use any references for this challenge.
