ðŸ—¼OSINT pt2: citadweller had a newfound interest in tracking the music they last listened to and posting ratings of new albums on various online platforms.

The flag is hidden in these digital footprints across music platforms and split into three segments. You will need to find all three to uncover the complete code and move on to the next floor.

## What I did
With the hint that the flag is hidden in three segments in different music platforms, I browesed through the various platforms for citadweller and found the three parts of the flag. I first got one part in spotify,
I then got one part in rate your music and the last part I got in lastfm.

spotify(flag part iii) - _n_then_they_were_'n0where_t0_be_f0ound}
rate your music(flag part ii) - _n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es
lastfm(flag part i) - citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n_

Therefore, the flag is - citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n_n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es_n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und}
