In this challenge we have to print out the flag variable.
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{YSExLfY5n3kvE-NSY2MoRHTB6de.QX3UTN0wCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge, I used $ before the FLAG to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{YSExLfY5n3kvE-NSY2MoRHTB6de.QX3UTN0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```
## What I Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn that by prepending a variable with $, it is going to print the value that is assigned to the variable.
