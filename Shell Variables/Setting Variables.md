In this challenge we have to set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE.
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{QB_umQRzYYH6DN_n79szyx5xnQt.QX5UTN0wCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge, I used the = operator to set the value of PWN as COLLEGE and got the flag.
```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{QB_umQRzYYH6DN_n79szyx5xnQt.QX5UTN0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn that the = operator with no spaces around it can write the value of the variable.
## Refernces
Did not use any references for this challenge.
