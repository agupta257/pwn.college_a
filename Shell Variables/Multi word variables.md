In this challenge we have to assign a value to the variable which contains spaces.
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{AfkGof5YrqNt-ENrGvRcDRBbu2V.QXwYTN0wCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge, I used "" to enclose the value which must be assigned.
```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{AfkGof5YrqNt-ENrGvRcDRBbu2V.QXwYTN0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```
