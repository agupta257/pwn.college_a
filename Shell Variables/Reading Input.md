In this challenge we have to use read to set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE.
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{8aGihmWUgY6LXJeQ4lh8_ZIHG1N.QX4cTN0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```bash
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT: " PWN
INPUT: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{8aGihmWUgY6LXJeQ4lh8_ZIHG1N.QX4cTN0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```
