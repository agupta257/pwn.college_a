In this challenge we have to invoke a program by providing its path on the command line.
## My Solve
**Flag:**pwn.college{slydP79vaDsH-cJfwHUiHqOrmxj.QX4cTO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge, I first understood that the filesystem starts at /. This style of path, one that starts with the root directory, is referred to as an "absolute path".
To invoke the pwn program using its absolute path, we have to write /pwn.

hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{slydP79vaDsH-cJfwHUiHqOrmxj.QX4cTO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
