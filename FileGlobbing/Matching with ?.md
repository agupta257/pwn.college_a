**Flag:**pwn.college{oGOCIQ4LCQ48qR-Naxh4vgOToLJ.QXyIDO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge, I used the ? character instead of c and l in challenge and changed my directory to /challenge and then wrote /challenge/run to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{oGOCIQ4LCQ48qR-Naxh4vgOToLJ.QXyIDO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```
