In this challenge we have to write a single, short glob that will match the files "challenging", "educational", and "pwning".
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{s5foRgsC1dJP6ohgyr5Go0yPQJT.QX1IDO0wCN4kjNzEzW}

In this challenge, I used the * and [] glob to match the flags and get the flag.
```bash
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{s5foRgsC1dJP6ohgyr5Go0yPQJT.QX1IDO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```
## What I Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn that to use different globs at once to get the result.
## Refernces
Did not use any references for this challenge.
