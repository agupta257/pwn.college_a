**Flag:**pwn.college{M5aGAJ87ePbv_2WeQAjV1du9Qei.0VN0EzNxwCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge, I wrote pwncollege and then pressed tab. It completed pwncollege to  pwncollege-12418 and then i pressed enter to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-12418
.bash_history  .config/       .lesshst       a              not-the-flag
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-12418
