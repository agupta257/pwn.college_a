In this challenge we have to read the manual page of challenge and get the flag.
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{AZIs2Tlj-AqwLRIcYTTFF0oo2Fj.QXxIDO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge I used cd /ch* to change my directrory to /challenge and then wrote /challenge/run to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AZIs2Tlj-AqwLRIcYTTFF0oo2Fj.QXxIDO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```
