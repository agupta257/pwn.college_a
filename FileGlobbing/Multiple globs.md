In this challenge we have to find the flag by providing a single argument.
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{Ai6SqZqGe9fYmny0uunvAiIEw_e.0lM3kjNxwCN4kjNzEzW}

In this challenge, I ran /challenge/run and provided *p* argument to it to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Ai6SqZqGe9fYmny0uunvAiIEw_e.0lM3kjNxwCN4kjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn that we can specify more than one glob at a time.
