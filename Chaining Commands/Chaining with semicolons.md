In this challenge we have to run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, chaining them with a semicolon.
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{IGXshEy6CqXVT9bbV2bUXsSBvw4.QX1UDO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge, I used the semicolon after /challenge/pwn and then typed /challenge/college.
```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IGXshEy6CqXVT9bbV2bUXsSBvw4.QX1UDO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
