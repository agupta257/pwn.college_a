In this challenge we have to sort the fake flags and real flag using the sort command.
## My Solve

**Flag:**pwn.college{gpa8tX5HlCKOKNLr1tkQW2QYurA.0FM0MDOxwCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge, I used the sort command to sort out the real flag from the fake flagscin the /challenge/flags.txt file. The real flag was at the end.
```bash
hacker@data~sorting-data:~$ sort /challenge/flags.txt
```
## What I Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn that the sort command orders line alphabetically.
