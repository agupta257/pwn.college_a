In this challenge we have to ivoke /challenge/challenge properly in order for it to get the flag.
## My Solve

**Flag:** pwn.college{QRyJE10tmZvXnYTup2xZ5KF-W6K.QX0ITO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
In this challenge, I used the argument of --giveflag for /challenge/challenge to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QRyJE10tmZvXnYTup2xZ5KF-W6K.QX0ITO0wCN4kjNzEzW}
```
