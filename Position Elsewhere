In this challenge, I executed /challenge/run program from a specific path which was the /var directory. I used the cd to that directory before rerunning the challenge program.

hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/doc/fontconfig directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /usr/share/doc/fontconfig
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/usr/share/doc/fontconfig$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
