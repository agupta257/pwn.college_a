This challenge asks to inject the flag into your history.
## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{s832PfquMlhgsAh9VzGvjljoFWE.0lNzEzNxwCN4kjNzEzW}
For this challenge I learnt how the shell stored and recalls previous commands. A command line session keeps a history of commands in memory. I opened the terminal and hit the upwards arrow key to get the flag.
'''bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{s832PfquMlhgsAh9VzGvjljoFWE.0lNzEzNxwCN4kjNzEzW}
'''
