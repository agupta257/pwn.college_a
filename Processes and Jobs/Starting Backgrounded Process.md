In this challenge, I appended & to /challenge/run, for it to start in the background.
```bash
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
```

## What I Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn that appending a command with & would make it start in the background.
