In this challenge, I first suspended /challenge/run to the background using Ctrl-Z and then re-run it.
```bash
hacker@processes~suspending-processes:~$ /challenge/run
^Z
hacker@processes~suspending-processes:~$ /challenge/run
```

## What I Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn that using Ctrl-Z suspends the process to the background.
